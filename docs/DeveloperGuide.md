### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/condonery/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/condonery/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete -p 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PropertyListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/condonery/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Property` and 'Client' objects residing in the `Model`.
* The UI also depends on UserPrefs to determine where to store images uploaded by the user.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/condonery/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `CondoneryParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddPropertyCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a property).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete -p 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeletePropertyCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `CondoneryParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPropertyCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPropertyCommand`) which the `CondoneryParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPropertyCommandParser`, `DeletePropertyCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/condonery/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Property` and `Client` objects (which are contained in `UniquePropertyList` and `UniqueClientList` objects respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Property` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Property>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `PropertyDirectory`, which `Property` references. This allows `PropertyDirectory` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Property` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/condonery/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `PropertyDirectoryStorage`, `ClientDirectoryStorage`, and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.condonery.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Select property/client feature

The select feature is meant to expand on either a `Property` or a `Client` to display its details in the GUI. Importantly, a `Property` can hold a list of interested clients and a `Client` can hold a list of properties that the client is interested in. Depending on if a `Property` or `Client` is selected, the GUI changes to show just the selected `Property`/`Client` in its respective tab, and its interested clients/intersted properties in the other tab. The select command is as follows:
```
select -[pc] [INDEX]
```
The compulsory input `INDEX` would correspond to the current displayed list in the GUi.
Examples of usage:
* `select -p 2`
* `select -c 10`


### Range feature

The range feature allows the user to filter properties by a price range in Condonery.

The feature is activated by the command pattern `range -p l/[lower] u/[upper]`.

**Parsing of command within the `Logic` component**

Much like the other core features, we introduced an intermediate between `CondoneryParser` and the range command parser,
that is the `RangePropertyCommandParser`.

These are the steps that will be taken when parsing a range command:

1. The `CondoneryParser` checks if the user command is a range command. Then it creates a `RangePropertyCommandParser`.
2. The `RangePropertyCommandParser` which implements the `Parser` interface, parses the command via `Parser#parse`.
3. If the user command is valid, the parser creates the corresponding `Command` object for execution.

Given below is a sequence diagram for interactions inside the Logic component for the `execute(range -p l/<LOWER> u/<UPPER>`
API call. Note that the command (e.g., `range -p l/100,000 u/500,000`)is truncated for brevity.

![RangeSequenceDiagram](images/RangeSequenceDiagram.png)

**Execution of command within the `Logic` component**

When a `RangePropertyCommand` is created by the `RangePropertyCommandParser`, it is executed with `model` passed in
as the parameter.

Firstly, the `updateFilteredPropertyList` is called to get the list of properties within the specified price range.

Next, a `CommandResult` object containing the message to be displayed to the user is returned to `LogicManager`.

![RangeExecuteSequenceDiagram](images/RangeExecuteSequenceDiagram.png)

**Error handling within the `Logic` component**

The below activity diagram shows the overall process of execution of `execute(range -p l/100 u/200)`.

In order to ensure data cleanliness and that the inputs by the users are valid, errors are thrown at various stages if:

- Incorrect command format is used (e.g. missing price as argument, missing prefixes)
- Arguments are invalid (e.g. negative prices)

![RangeActivityDiagram](images/RangeActivityDiagram.png)

**Design consideration**

Aspect: How to filter properties by prices

- **Alternative 1** (current choice): Add a lower and upper prefix to command phrase to indicate lower and upper bound.
    - Pros:
      - Less time-consuming to implement.
      - Easier to parse price range.
    - Cons:
      - Imposes strict requirement on use of lower and upper prefixes.
- **Alternative 2**: Allow user to key in two separate integers in command.
  - Pros:
    - Easy and fairly intuitive user input system
  - Cons:
    - More time-consuming to implement.
    - Need extra checking to correctly parse two separate integers and identify lower and upper bounds.
    - More prone to manual user entry error.

Alternative 1 was chosen to enable more efficient parsing of commands.

### Filter feature

The filter feature returns a list of properties whose tags contain any of the given keywords.

The feature is activated by the command pattern `filter -p TAG [MORE_TAGS]`.

**Parsing of command within the `Logic` component**

Much like the other core features, we introduced an intermediate between `CondoneryParser` and the filter command parser,
that is the `FilterPropertyCommandParser`.

These are the steps that will be taken when parsing a range command:

1. The `CondoneryParser` checks if the user command is a filter command. Then it creates a `FilterPropertyCommandParser`.
2. The `FilterPropertyCommandParser` which implements the `Parser` interface, parses the command via `Parser#parse`.
3. If the user command is valid, the parser creates the corresponding `Command` object for execution.

Given below is a sequence diagram for interactions inside the Logic component for the `execute(range -p l/<LOWER> u/<UPPER>`
API call. Note that the command (e.g., `filter -p High-end Luxury` is truncated for brevity.

![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

**Execution of command within the `Logic` component**

When a `FilterPropertyCommand` is created by the `FilterPropertyCommandParser`, it is executed with `model` passed in
as the parameter.

Firstly, the `updateFilteredPropertyList` is called to get the list of properties whose tags match any of the given arguments.

Next, a `CommandResult` object containing the message to be displayed to the user is returned to `LogicManager`.

![FilterExecuteSequenceDiagram](images/FilterExecuteSequenceDiagram.png)

**Error handling within the `Logic` component**

The below activity diagram shows the overall process of execution of `execute(range -p l/100 u/200`.

In order to ensure data cleanliness and that the inputs by the users are valid, errors are thrown at various stages if:

- Incorrect command format is used (e.g. missing tag argument)

![RangeActivityDiagram](images/RangeActivityDiagram.png)

### Filter by Property Status Feature [Yue Hern]
This feature allows users to filter properties by `PropertyStatusEnum`. 

The feature is activated by the command patter `status -p [property_status]`

**Parsing of command within the Logic component**

This command uses the `StatusPropertyCommandParser` to parse the command.

These are the steps that will be taken when parsing a range command:

1. The `CondoneryParser` checks if the user command is a range command. Then it creates a `StatusPropertyCommandParser`.
2. The `StatusPropertyCommandParser` which implements the `Parser` interface, parses the command via `Parser#parse`.
3. If the user `command` is valid, the parser creates the corresponding `Command` object for execution.

![StatusPropertySequenceDiagram](images/StatusPropertySequenceDiagram.png)

**Execution of command within the Logic component**

When a `StatusPropertyCommand` is created by the `StatusPropertyCommandParser`, it is executed with model passed in as the parameter.

Firstly, the `updateFilteredPropertyList` is called to get the list of properties within the specified price range.

Next, a `CommandResult` object containing the message to be displayed to the user is returned to `LogicManager`.

**Error handling within the Logic component**

![StatusPropertyActivityDiagram](images/StatusPropertyActivityDiagram.png)

**Design consideration**

Aspect: Input format for `StatusPropertyCommand`

- **Alternative 1** (current choice): Accept both lower and upper case for `StatusPropertyCommand` argument
(e.g. accept both `status -p available` and `status -p AVAILABLE` inputs)
  - Pros: 
    - Less prone to error for the user
    - More intuitive for the user
  - Cons:
    - Format be confusing for user
- **Alternative 2**: Only accept upper case input for `StatusPropertyCommand`
  - Cons:
    - More prone to error
    - User has to follow case, which can be troublesome

- Alternative 1 was chosen because of its ease of use, more intuitive, and less error-prone reasons.


### Commands

#### \[Proposed\] Search Command

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed search command allows the user to search for a particular `Property`. It is facilitated by `SearchCommand`.
It extends the `Command` class.

Users can specify if they want to perform the search for a `Property` or `Client` with the following
options

1. `-p` Search for a particular property with matching keywords
2. `-c` Search for a particular client with matching keywords

#### Parsing of commands within the `Logic` component

The parsing of commands begins once the `LogicManager` receives and tries to execute the user input.

To parse the different commands in our application, we have individual command parsers for the different commands
(e.g. `EditCommandParser`).

The steps taken when parsing a search command are as follows:

1. The `SearchCommandParser` will check what type (`Property` or `Client`) the search is for
and create the corresponding parser
   1. `search -p` will create the command: `SearchPropertyCommand`
   2. `search -c` will create the command: `SearchClientCommand`
3. The respective parsers all implement the `Parser` interface, and the `Parser#parse` method will then be called.

#### Design Considerations:

- Create a `SearchCommand` class

### User Uploaded Images [Haoren]

The application allows users to upload their own images for Property and Client models. By default, the images are stored
in `data/images`, but users can specify their custom directory in `preferences.json`.

The Image object is not initialized until the PropertyCard/ClientCard of the UI is rendered. This is to save memory
consumption and rely on the Lazy Loading of Observable List. We need to inject the UserPrefs into the Property/Client
models in order to determine the location to source for the uploaded images.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1:** Saves the initial PropertyDirectory and ClientDirectory on initialization. Store all commands in
CommandQueue and re-executes _n - 1_ commands on undo.
    * Pros: Easy to implement. Less memory usage
    * Cons: Might make undo command less responsive, depending on complexity of commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 3:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
